# Themes for tibl

Below are some example classless css themes that were applied to tibl.
Click on the buttons, they will change the currently applied style.


_Note: Some themes are not that classless and have to be tweaked to work well. Refer to each theme's documentation._

### Sakura

Sakura is (for now) tibl's default theme. It comes in quite a few variants.
